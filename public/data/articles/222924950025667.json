Credit Card Payments are the payments where regular invoices were paid by credit card via <strong>Record Credit Card Payments</strong>. See the section for \"CORRECTING CREDIT CARD STATEMENT INVOICES\" to correct a statement invoice.</p> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">Examples of errors that you can correct using reversing (negative) and correcting credit card payments:</p> <div class=\"style1\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"> <ul> <li>The wrong credit card was selected.</li> <li>The wrong vendor was paid.</li> <li>The wrong prefix was entered.</li> <li>The wrong payment date was entered.</li> <li>The wrong invoice accounting date was entered.</li> <li>A fraudulent charge was on one month's statement and was reversed on the following month's statement or an&nbsp;item was returned and refunded back to the credit card. Refer to [[How do I enter a credit card refund in Accounts Payable when using Credit Card Management?|240709154851080]]&nbsp;</li> </ul> </div> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">To correct these types of errors, enter a negative payment using the original information and a positive payment with the correct information. However, in the case of a refund you will not enter a positive payment.</p> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">EXAMPLE: The wrong payment date was entered</p> <ol dir=\"ltr\"> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter a negative invoice and payment using the original payment date: <ol> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Select <strong>Tasks</strong>, <strong>Record Payments by Credit Card</strong>.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Select or enter the <strong>Credit Card</strong>.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter a <strong>Reference ID</strong>.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter the <strong>Date</strong> the same date as the original, incorrect payment date.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter the same original <strong>Vendor</strong>.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter the <strong>Amount</strong> of the payment as a negative.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Enter the reversing invoice and distribution information, using the same date and coding that you used on the original payment, but enter the amounts as negatives.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Accept the distribution, the invoice, and the payment.</li> </ol> </li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Use the task again to enter a positive payment to the correct date.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>CORRECTING CREDIT CARD STATEMENT INVOICES:</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">You can delete but not edit credit card statement invoices.</p> <ul dir=\"ltr\"> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">To change the statement invoice, delete it first in <strong>Tasks</strong>, <strong>Change Invoices</strong> and then enter it again using <strong>Tasks</strong>, <strong>Verify Statement Balance</strong>.</li> <li style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">If the statement invoice has been paid, void the payment and then delete the invoice.</li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">See [[I made an error in Verify Statement Balance when I created the credit card statement invoice in Accounts Payable|223924550037517]]</p> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><strong>ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES:</strong></p> <p><strong>SCENARIO 1:</strong> Credit card payment was recorded with an incorrect payment date.
