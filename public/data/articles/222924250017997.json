      "content": "<p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\">Outdated master and transaction file records may make it difficult to track your current work. Archiving reduces the size of your master and transaction files, which makes tasks such as printing faster. It also reduces the number of jobs that appear on job selection windows.</p> <p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\"><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">IMPORTANT:</span></p> <ul style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\"> <li>No one can be in the system during the move. Have all operators exit Sage during the move process and close all third-party applications that use Sage. Stop any processes like MyAssistant scheduled reports during the move.</li> <li>Make a backup of both the live folder and archive folder before moving.</li> <li>Typically, you don't archive jobs with cost entries in the current or prior year, as that can affect reconciliations between JC and interfacing applications, especially GL.</li> <li>You'll want to move transactions in \"chunks\" of 20-30 jobs to start. If moving transactions for 20-30 jobs takes less than 10 minutes, you can increase to 50-60 jobs. However, if 20-30 jobs take 3 hours, you may want to move smaller chunks of transactions. Using ranges to select chunks of jobs may be easier than using conditions. Repeat the steps for each move of 20-30 jobs, including making a new backup of BOTH the live and archive folders between each chunk. For example, make a backup, then move transactions and then move jobs. Then, make another backup and move another chunk of transactions and jobs.</li> <li>Move the transactions before you move the jobs or commitments. You can move the commitments at the same time you move the jobs.</li> <li>You don't have to close the year in Job Cost before you move jobs or transactions. These are independent functions.</li> <li>There's no warning if you try to move commitments that are open, not fully invoiced, or not fully paid.</li> <li>We recommend keeping transactions and closed jobs in the same folder for reporting purposes. It would be best to select Current to Current when moving transactions and selecting the closed jobs folder for the destination file.</li> <li>Use File Doctor to compact the source files when you've moved all transactions and jobs.</li> <li>If you have Project Management, you will want to archive the same jobs in Project Management at the same time. If the job remains in Project Management, a user could accidentally create the job again in Job Cost.</li> <li>Don't move Jobs with balances in AR and AP to the archive folder. If you move a job to archive and you make an entry in the current year to that archive job, you should move the job and its transactions back to the live folder and leave them until the following year.</li> <li>Don't reuse job numbers that you moved to an archive folder. Interfacing applications will still have transactions for the archived job, and reports will reflect those amounts in interfacing applications, which may cause conflicting totals and reconciliation issues.</li> </ul> <p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pre-Move Checklist:</span><br>Perform the following steps before closing jobs in preparation for archiving.</p> <p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">NOTE:</span> Perform Steps 2, 3 and 4 before moving unless following the close job recommended workflow. You don't have to complete Steps 1 and 5 for moving, however they're a best recommendation as they make the moving process smoother.</p> <p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\">&nbsp;</p> <ol style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\"> <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Job Cost</span>: <ol> <li>Go to&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Job Cost</span>,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Setup</span>,<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Job</span>.</li> <li>Select the job to close.</li> <li>On the&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">status&nbsp;</span>tab, select&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Closed</span>.
