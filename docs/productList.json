A connected account allows Office 365 to send and receive mail for a mailbox that's hosted outside your Office 365. For example, Gmail, Yahoo Mail or your own domain email. It uses POP or IMAP settings to  download existing emails stored on the other mail server,  and any new emails you receive. Connected accounts don't change anything in the original email account,  so you can continue to access  emails through the original system if required.</p><p class=\"note\"><strong>Note: </strong>When you send an email from a connected account, it shows as sent from your Office 365 email address on behalf of the connected account address.</p><p>If  you use Hotmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo Mail or Gmail, for further help please refer to the following articles:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ask.sage.co.uk/scripts/ask.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=35339\" title=\"35339\" target=\"_blank\">35339</a>&nbsp;- Connect your Hotmail or Outlook.com account to your Office 365 Outlook Web App</li><li><a href=\"https://ask.sage.co.uk/scripts/ask.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=35332\" title=\"35332\" target=\"_blank\">35332</a>&nbsp;- Connect Gmail to your Office 365 Outlook Web App</li><li><a href=\"https://gb-kb.sage.com/portal/app/portlets/results/viewsolution.jsp?solutionid=2004271123496690\" title=\"35340\" target=\"_blank\">35340</a>&nbsp;- Connect AOL Mail to your Office 365 Outlook Web App</li><li><a href=\"https://ask.sage.co.uk/scripts/ask.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=35331\" title=\"35331\" target=\"_blank\">35331</a>&nbsp;- Connect Yahoo Mail to your Office 365 Outlook Web App</li></ul><p>If you're using any other webmail or email, please refer to the following articles:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ask.sage.co.uk/scripts/ask.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=35440\" title=\"35440\" target=\"_blank\">35440</a> - Connecting Office 365 to your existing email, contacts and calendar</li><li>Microsoft article - <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Connect-email-accounts-in-Outlook-on-the-web-Office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d\"  target=\"_blank\">Connect email accounts in Outlook on the web (Office 365)</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Migrating a custom domain</h4><p>If your business has its  <strong>own domain web address</strong>, to use this domain   for your emails within Office 365 you can add the domain to Office 365. </p><p>For help with this, please refer to the following articles:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ask.sage.co.uk/scripts/ask.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=35314\" target=\"_blank\">35314</a> - How to migrate your domain email and DNS settings to Office 365     </li><li><a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-and-domain-to-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611\" target=\"_blank\">Add users and domain to Office 365</a></li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> Once you migrate your domain to Office 365, any new incoming emails redirect to Office 365 and emails are  no longer  delivered to your previous email system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Migration from Exchange  Server 2003 or above</h4><p>If you <strong>currently use Exchange Server 2003 or above</strong>, you can migrate emails, contacts, calendars and tasks  for multiple mailboxes to Exchange Online.
